#### Adjusted Net (grading on the curve)
 The calculation of the adjusted handicap will be based on an adjusted net score for each round. The adjusted net score is the (net score) - (median net score for that round). For example, if the median net score for Round 1 is +2.  A net score of -1 would be adjusted to -3, a net score of +2 would be adjusted to zero, and a net score of +4 would be adjusted to +2.
- ##### Round 1  
  - Use original handicap
- ##### Round 2 
  - Adjustment = (R1 AdjNet) / 2
  - Maximum adjustment is plus or minus 1
  - Adjusted Handicap = Original handicap + adjustment
- ##### Round 3
  - Adjustment = (R1 AdjNet + R2 AdjNet) / 3
  - Maximum adjustment is plus or minus 1
  - Adjusted Handicap = Original handicap + adjustment
- ##### Round 4
  - Adjustment = (R1 AdjNet + R2 AdjNet + R3 AdjNet) / 4
  - Maximum adjustment is plus or minus 3
  - Adjusted Handicap = Original handicap + adjustment
- ##### Round 5
  - Adjustment = (R1 AdjNet + R2 AdjNet + R3 AdjNet + R4 AdjNet) / 5
  - Maximum adjustment is plus or minus 3
  - Adjusted Handicap = Original handicap + adjustment
